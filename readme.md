# TODO:
## Eye-catchign Portfolio plan:
### First and foremost:
- using the raycaster demo:
    - replace knife-hand with spaceship HUD
    - replace creepy ruins with space and planets
    - figure out a way to present portfolio data

### Secondly:
- maybe make each part of the portfolio a different planet
    - browse details by landing?
    - moving up and down? Moving into planet orbit?

### Thirdly
- improve mobile controls
- optimize a bit
